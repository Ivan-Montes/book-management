included inside the project folder
     

## Requirements

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is required to run certain services

Working with React requires that Node.js is installed. We can find the installation instructions on the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

   
## Usage
  
Some projects require execute the docker compose file located in the same project folder

```    
    **Developer mode: start**  
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
    
     **Developer mode: stop**
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down --rmi local -v

```

Each project has a folder called frontend. It's located in the main directory, inside the src folder. From there, run Node, it listens for web requests on port 3000

```
npm run dev
```
